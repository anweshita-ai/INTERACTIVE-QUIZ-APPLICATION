### Task Description: Interactive Quiz Application - Quiz Master Pro

The task involves creating a fully functional, responsive, and visually appealing Interactive Quiz Application called Quiz Master Pro. This application uses core front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with an engaging platform to test their knowledge in various categories such as Technology, Logic, General Knowledge, and Science. The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly, dynamic quiz interface that is both educational and entertaining.

### Technologies and Tools Used

1. **HTML5**  
   HTML structures the entire content of the application. The layout has three key sections: the start screen, where users enter their name and choose quiz settings; the quiz screen, which shows the questions, timer, and answer buttons; and the result screen, which displays the final score and a leaderboard. Form elements like `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<button>` effectively gather user inputs.

2. **CSS3**  
   CSS handles the design and layout of the application. A soft, gradient background creates a calming visual theme. Animations like `fadeInUp`, transitions, and hover effects improve interactivity and aesthetics. Buttons and inputs have rounded corners and shadows for a modern user interface. The font "Poppins" from Google Fonts adds a clean and professional look.

3. **JavaScript (ES6)**  
   JavaScript manages the core logic of the quiz. It controls the display of questions, shuffles answers, counts down the timer, handles user interactions, and makes dynamic updates to the DOM. Key functionalities include:

   * Question rendering based on the selected category
   * Timer implementation (15 seconds per question)
   * Answer validation with visual and audio feedback
   * Score tracking
   * Leaderboard management using LocalStorage

4. **LocalStorage API**  
   This API stores the top 5 quiz scores on the user's browser. It keeps leaderboard data intact even after a page refresh. Scores are sorted and displayed on the result screen in ranked order.

5. **Audio Feedback**  
   Sound effects for correct and wrong answers are included using HTML `<audio>` tags and triggered by JavaScript. These sounds improve engagement and provide immediate feedback to the user.

6. **Editor Platform: Visual Studio Code**  
   Development was done using VS Code, a lightweight and powerful code editor. Features like syntax highlighting, extensions such as Live Server, and an integrated terminal make it suitable for building and testing this type of project.

### Main Features

* User name input before the quiz starts
* Category selection: Tech, Logic, GK, Science
* Timer for each question (15 seconds)
* Answer validation with visual and audio feedback
* Score display at the end of the quiz
* Local leaderboard showing the top 5 scores
* Restart button to replay the quiz
* Mobile-responsive layout for all screen sizes
* Clean, animated UI for a modern experience

### Real-World Applications

This quiz application has many real-world uses:

* **Education**: Used in schools and colleges for quizzes, assessments, and revision.
* **E-learning Platforms**: Integrated into online courses for self-evaluation.
* **Events and Competitions**: Used in tech fests, school events, or clubs for interactive quiz sessions.
* **Recruitment Tests**: Adapted for aptitude or knowledge-based screening.
* **Self-learning**: Helps users practice trivia, general knowledge, or logical reasoning independently.

Quiz Master Pro combines creativity, logic, and responsive design. It is an excellent example of a front-end development project that shows technical skills while serving educational and recreational purposes.
